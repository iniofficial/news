                        After winning the ODI series 2-1, a confident Bangladesh side will be gearing up to put in a similar dominant showing in the T20Is against Afghanistan. While teams prepare for the upcoming T20 World Cup later this year, both Afghanistan and Bangladesh have taken a different approach to prepare themselves for the mega event.
Bangladesh have dropped some of their senior players from the team following their poor performance in the 2021 T20 World Cup and having lost their last eight straight T20Is. And one of their most experienced players Tamim Iqbal will also be missing as he has opted out of T20Is for six months.
But the team are continuing to rely primarily on experienced players, and with Liton Das, Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan back, Bangladesh will fancy their team's chances.
The Tigers will continue with the same pace trio who did the job for them in the ODI series. With Mustafizur Rahman leading the attack it will be interesting to see how Bangladesh utilise the other two pacers, Taskin Ahmed and Shoriful Islam.
Afghanistan have opted to experiment, bringing in some new players into a young squad. Mohammad Shahzad, Gulbadin Naib, Hamid Hassan and Hashmatullah Shahidi have made way for some of the newcomers like Darwish Rasooli, Azmatullah Omarzai and Nijat Masood.
With plenty of young players in the squad, the pressure will be on captain Mohammad Nabi and Najibullah Zadaran to set the standard. And while Afghanistan's spin trio of Rashid Kahn, Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Nabi remains a foundation of strength, their new-look pace attack will be interesting to watch.
Although Afghanistan lost the ODI series, their players produced some impactful performances. Left-arm pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi has been one of the biggest positives for Afghanistan, while Rahmanullah Gurbaz with a century in the last ODI will be a key player to watch in the T20Is.

                        Young people between the ages of 12-20 have reported several cases of a multi-system inflammatory syndrome, otherwise known as MIS-C, where the immune system goes on overdrive after being vaccinated for COVID-19, according to a recent Lancet report. 

The report noted MIS-C is a rare condition that can happen two to six weeks after COVID-19 infection with patients complaining of fever and showing signs and symptoms of multi-organ involvement with systemic inflammation. 

"Patients with MIS-C usually present with persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, mucocutaneous lesions and, in severe cases, with hypotension and shock," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on their website. The agency added the illness "may begin weeks after a child is infected with SARS-CoV-2. The child may have been infected from an asymptomatic contact and, in some cases, the child and their caregivers may not even know they had been infected." 

First recognized in April 2020, 5973 cases were reported to the CDC between May 2020 to November 2021, with the study’s authors hypothesizing the illness develops because of a hyperactive immune response to COVID-19 infection in susceptible patients who have a genetic predisposition for the syndrome. But the study investigated if the syndrome also occurred after COVID-19 vaccination. The study analyzed the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for potential cases of MIS-C after COVID-19 vaccination from Dec. 14, 2020, to Aug. 31, 2021, in individuals aged 12─20 years, identifying 21 young people, with a mean age of 16 years old, who met the CDC’s definition of the inflammatory condition. 

The researchers noted all of these patients were hospitalized, 57% were admitted directly to the intensive care unit, with 71% with laboratory evidence of past or recent COVID-19 infection, but all were discharged home. 

Even though six young people in the study didn’t have evidence of a prior COVID-19 infection, the researchers hypothesized because the lab assays have limited sensitivity for asymptomatic infections, the young participants might have been infected with COVID-19 even though they tested negative, so "vaccination might be coincidental to the subsequent MIS-C illness." 

Over 21 million individuals ages 12-20 years old received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine as of August 31, 2021, so the overall reporting rate for MIS-C after vaccination is 1 case per million people compared to a rate of 0.3 cases per million vaccinated individuals among those without prior laboratory evidence of COVID-19, per the study.  

These rates are "substantially lower than the previously published incidence of MIS-C among unvaccinated individuals in this age group in the USA who had SARS-CoV-2 infection (approximately 200 cases per million SARS-CoV-2 infections)," the researchers said.

                        For more than a year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has collected data on hospitalizations for Covid-19 in the United States and broken it down by age, race and vaccination status. But it has not made most of the information public.

When the C.D.C. published the first significant data on the effectiveness of boosters in adults younger than 65 two weeks ago, it left out the numbers for a huge portion of that population: 18- to 49-year-olds, the group least likely to benefit from extra shots, because the first two doses already left them well-protected.

The agency recently debuted a dashboard of wastewater data on its website that will be updated daily and might provide early signals of an oncoming surge of Covid cases. Some states and localities had been sharing wastewater information with the agency since the start of the pandemic, but it had never before released those findings.

Two full years into the pandemic, the agency leading the country’s response to the public health emergency has published only a tiny fraction of the data it has collected, several people familiar with the data said.

Much of the withheld information could help state and local health officials better target their efforts to bring the virus under control. Detailed, timely data on hospitalizations by age and race would help health officials identify and help the populations at highest risk. Information on hospitalizations and death by age and vaccination status would have helped inform whether healthy adults needed booster shots. And wastewater surveillance across the nation would spot outbreaks and emerging variants early.

Without the booster data for 18- to 49-year-olds, the outside experts whom federal health agencies look to for advice had to rely on numbers from Israel to make their recommendations on the shots.

Kristen Nordlund, a spokeswoman for the C.D.C., said the agency has been slow to release the different streams of data “because basically, at the end of the day, it’s not yet ready for prime time.” She said the agency’s “priority when gathering any data is to ensure that it’s accurate and actionable.”

Another reason is fear that the information might be misinterpreted, Ms. Nordlund said.

Dr. Daniel Jernigan, the agency’s deputy director for public health science and surveillance said the pandemic exposed the fact that data systems at the C.D.C., and at the state levels, are outmoded and not up to handling large volumes of data. C.D.C. scientists are trying to modernize the systems, he said.

“We want better, faster data that can lead to decision making and actions at all levels of public health, that can help us eliminate the lag in data that has held us back,” he added.

The C.D.C. also has multiple bureaucratic divisions that must sign off on important publications, and its officials must alert the Department of Health and Human Services — which oversees the agency — and the White House of their plans. The agency often shares data with states and partners before making data public. Those steps can add delays.

“The C.D.C. is a political organization as much as it is a public health organization,” said Samuel Scarpino, managing director of pathogen surveillance at the Rockefeller Foundation’s Pandemic Prevention Institute. “The steps that it takes to get something like this released are often well outside of the control of many of the scientists that work at the C.D.C.”

The performance of vaccines and boosters, particularly in younger adults, is among the most glaring omissions in data the C.D.C. has made public.

Last year, the agency repeatedly came under fire for not tracking so-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated Americans, and focusing only on individuals who became ill enough to be hospitalized or die. The agency presented that information as risk comparisons with unvaccinated adults, rather than provide timely snapshots of hospitalized patients stratified by age, sex, race and vaccination status. But the C.D.C. has been routinely collecting information since the Covid vaccines were first rolled out last year, according to a federal official familiar with the effort. The agency has been reluctant to make those figures public, the official said, because they might be misinterpreted as the vaccines being ineffective.

Ms. Nordlund confirmed that as one of the reasons. Another reason, she said, is that the data represents only 10 percent of the population of the United States. But the C.D.C. has relied on the same level of sampling to track influenza for years.

Some outside public health experts were stunned to hear that information exists.

“We have been begging for that sort of granularity of data for two years,” said Jessica Malaty Rivera, an epidemiologist and part of the team that ran Covid Tracking Project, an independent effort that compiled data on the pandemic till March 2021.

A detailed analysis, she said, “builds public trust, and it paints a much clearer picture of what’s actually going on.”

Concern about the misinterpretation of hospitalization data broken down by vaccination status is not unique to the C.D.C. On Thursday, public health officials in Scotland said they would stop releasing data on Covid hospitalizations and deaths by vaccination status because of similar fears that the figures would be misrepresented by anti-vaccine groups.

                        Networks for the supply and distribution of fake Indian currency notes (FICN) appear to have proliferated in Bangladesh over the past year, the culmination of a long sequence of developments originating more than two decades ago.

While some cities in Bangladesh were long-known to be hubs of the counterfeit currency racket, the recent spurt in the illicit import of FICN into India through the border was a cause of concern that has also set alarm bells ringing in several departments of the Indian government, an investigating official told The Diplomat.

On February 9, police in Dhaka seized a large number of gunny bags filled with a colossal quantity of FICN and arrested some people suspected to have been involved in the racket. An official told the media that it was the largest ever consignment of fake Indian currency to have been confiscated in Bangladesh.

Last year in November, police officials were quoted by the media in Dhaka as saying that a Lahore-based syndicate in Pakistan prints FICN, which are then transported to Bangladesh via Sri Lanka in containers loaded with marble stones. The consignments are hidden in “special chambers” at the homes of syndicate members before being smuggled into India.
