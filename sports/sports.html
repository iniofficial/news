Manchester United 3-2 Tottenham: Match Statistics

If Cristiano Ronaldo promises to return from every trip to Portugal with a hat-trick, Ralf Rangnick would probably grant his star striker a mini-break every week. 

After a week in which his off-field activity provoked more debate, the Manchester United forward showed on it why he will be remembered as one of the greatest of all time by hitting a sensational treble in a 3-2 win over Tottenham.

                        <p>
                            Right then! Here is the equation going into Day 3 of this Test - Sri Lanka need 419 runs to win while India require 9 wickets to win this Test as well as the series. Sri Lanka will need to bat out of their skins going ahead in this Test and India will look to make early inroads in the first session on Day 3 and keep the visitors at bay. Will India pick 9 wickets on Day 3 itself and seal the series? We shall find that soon. The action on Day 3 begins at 2 pm IST (8.30 am GMT). But as usual, our buildup will begin much earlier. Do join us for the same. Till then, Adios!
